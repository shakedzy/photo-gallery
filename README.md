# My Photo Gallery

I really like to photograph, but every time I do, I end asking myself the same question over and over - now what? What am I going to do with these photos now? I realized this is one of the things that's blocking me from picking up the camera more often and go shooting. Instagram forces me to crop the photos if I upload more than one each time, and I didn't like all these photographers social networks like 500px and YouPic.

Which how I ended up creating my own gallery, just for myself. I don't know if anyone's ever going to visit these pages and see these photos, but it doesn't matter too much. This is my gallery, and now photos have a home.
