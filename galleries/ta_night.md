Night photography is magic. It's an entirely different thing, a whole other skill-set. The city embraces a new color palette, provided to it by its infinite lights - neon signs, street and traffic lights, passing cars - all sleeping or simply unnoticed during daytime. Balancing these lights to tell the right late-night story using a camera is art by itself. And it's something I haven't practiced for a long time, probably for about a decade, since I travelled to China, photographing lantern-lit alleys and red rear-lights.

And so, I packed up my gear after a random Friday dinner, dusted-off my tripod, and headed towards the city's marina to dust myself off too. I kept the shutter speed and aperture fixed through out most the night, practicing manual focus and different white-balancing options. Here are my favorites photos of that night, which I promised myself will not remain a one-time thing. Night photography is magic. I love magic.
