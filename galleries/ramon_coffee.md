There was a time when I had this little-bit crazy idea - drive all the way to Ramon Crater just to make coffee at the crater's edge, and then go back home. Just to be clear, we're talking about a little more than 2 hours driving in each direction, while making coffee and drinking it takes nomore than 20 minutes. 

I actually didn't need to try to hard to convince my brother and sister to join me, and we packed ourselves and some coffee on some arbitrary Saturday morning, and drove there. Besides having one of the best weekends ever thanks to the two of them, this was also the best view I ever had with my morning coffee. Which is why it's also so surprising to realize I have not taken a single photo of us actually drinking the coffee.. I guess it really was just an execuse :).
