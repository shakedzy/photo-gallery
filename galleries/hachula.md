The date: November 1st, 2020 - the day after our 3rd anniversary. The original plan was for Keren and I to have some alone time. All our palns for our vacations and anniversary were canceled due to COVID, and so we decided the least we can do is take a Sunday off while Ellie is with her nanny, and make a nice trip to Hula Valley. But like all plans during the pandemic time, this too suddenly changed, as apparently the Sunday which we took off was also taken off by the nanny, and from some reason we weren't aware of that. And so, our couple time became a family trip with Ellie, the first since the outbreak of COVID. It was way hotter than we thought, much fewer birds than we thought we'll see and Ellie didn't like to be strapped into her chair in the car for two hours in each direction - but overall, we were happy with this trip, even though nthing worked as we planned. After all, it's all about family time in the end.
