Keren and I got married at the end of 2017, and the morning after the wedding we were already on a flight to Slovenia. Due to the wedding, and the fact we moved to a new appartment three monthes prior to it, the first time we opened the Lonely Plant guide we bought was on the plane itself. So while our honeymoon to Slovenia had quite a few highlights, it wasn't the honeymoon we wanted - or to be more exact, the one Keren wanted :).

Which is why a year later Keren decided we need a second honeymoon, and after checking a few interesting destinations, we ended up with tickets to Japan for a three weeks trip. This time, we planned. We made an map with all the cool places we read and heard about, leanred the basics of how to commute and prepared ourselves. We've ended up in Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Himeji, Kanazawa and Shirakawa-go, and we had the best time ever.

As part of my preparations, I decide to buy a DSLR camera. I always loved to photograph, and Japan seemed to be a destination it wold be a mistake not to have a descent camera with me to. So this was my very first trip with my brand new Canon 77D. I did not regret buying it.
