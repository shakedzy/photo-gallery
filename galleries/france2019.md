As mostly everyone knows, Keren's extended family is French, living in Paris and Versailles. This means that while I've been to France more than once with her, I haven't visited anything outside these two cities. But I did hear a lot of stories from her about how much this country is beautiful. Which is why we've decided it's time to travel to other French locations, starting with Noramandy and Brittany - meaning I get to see Mont Saint-Michel, one of my dream destinations. 

We ended up 5 people traveling on April 2019: Keren and I, her monther, brother and his girlfriend, and we've been to Deauville, Etretat, Honfleur, Mont Saint-Michel, Saint Malo, Dinard, Dinan, Saint Suliac, Le Repas, Omaha Beach, Bayeux and Paris, of course. While I was guaranteed cloudly weather and rain, which is that region's typical weather, the sky were clear most of the time - and especially when we got to Mont Saint-Michel, which allowed me to witness it in all its glory.

This was my second trip with my Canon 77D. I also bought a polarizing filter for this one, which I experimented a lot with while shooting.
