If COVID wasn't a thing, these photos would have probably been buried along with other family photos. But COVID is a thing, and as a result, Eliie hasn't seen her grandparents for half a year straight. These photos are their first time at the park together, and so these photos suddenly have much more meaning. I would lie if I'd say these photos are good in terms of photography qualities, but that's really not the point here :).
